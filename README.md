# dreambook

`dreambook` converts a dream journal into an ebook.

## Requirements

- [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka)
- A dream journal, written in Org Mode format, similar in format to
  the one in `examples/dreams.org`.

Tested on Mac.  Probably works on Linux.

Resulting EPUB book tested in Calibre, on Apple Books (Mac, iPad,
iPhone), and occasionally on a Kindle and a Kobo device.

## Installation

- Clone this repository
- `cd` into the repository

## Usage

    ./dreambook

Then, open `dreams.epub` in your favorite ebook reader.

The default input file is `$HOME/org/dreams.org`; an optional introduction
file `$HOME/org/dreams-intro.org` can be used to set up frontmatter to the book
and `$HOME/org/dreams-collophon.org` can be used to set up any concluding content.
These file locations are configurable:

    ./dreambook -i /path/to/dreams.org -I /path/to/dreams-intro.org -C /path/to/dreams-collophon.org

## Other Actions

- `bb test` runs the tests
- `bb fmt` reformats the code using [`cljf`](https://github.com/candid82/cljf) (install separately)
