Fifteen friends and I go out for KFC. We're all in a VW bus, and I'm
sitting in the back, and I'm the only one who's not eating.

I feel like there are too many people in the house, and I'm trying to
find a quiet place to work. I go to the basement, but there are people
there too.  I find a small manhole and crawl into that. It's a tight
fit, but I can work there.
